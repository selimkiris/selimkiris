# Hi, I'm Selim Kırış! 

I am a senior Computer Engineering student at **Süleyman Demirel University**. I am a dedicated aspiring software engineer focusing on the **.NET ecosystem**, **Cloud Computing**, and **DevOps** methodologies.

### Technical Focus & Learning Path
 I am actively building a strong foundation in modern software architecture:
- **Backend Development:** Deep diving into **ASP.NET Core** & **C#**. Focusing on building scalable APIs and Clean Architecture.
- **Frontend Development:** Crafting interfaces with **React**, **TypeScript**, and modern styling tools.
- **Cloud Aspirations:** Currently exploring **Azure** fundamentals, **Docker** containerization, and **CI/CD** pipelines.
- **Creative Pursuit:** Exploring game mechanics and interactive environments using **Unity & C#**.
 
### Current Project
  I am currently developing a **"Next-Gen Dictionary"** project (a refined platform inspired by Ekşi Sözlük).
- **Goal:** To go live by June 2026 and provide a functional, community-driven platform.
- **Tech Stack:** ASP.NET Core, React, and PostgreSQL.
 
### Leadership & Soft Skills
  I believe that engineering is as much about people and management as it is about code:
- **Scout Leadership (11 Years):** Licensed leader at the Turkish Scouting Federation. Years of experience in wilderness survival, crisis management, and leading teams under pressure.
- **Theater Direction & Presidency:** I attended the Theater Club at my university for three years and spent my final year directing and writing. Managed every aspect of production—from scriptwriting and directing to stage design—culminating in successful, full-house performances.
- **Professional Discipline:** Currently working remotely for a US-based firm (**Bost Projects**), honing my time management and professional communication skills in a global environment.
